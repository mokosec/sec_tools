### php_curl.php

A lightweight php page using php_curl to make web requests and display the headers, content, and SSL certificate information.
Used mainly in trouble shooting and testing new sites. SSL certification checks are off for maximum visibility.

### php_converters.php

Yet another converter page. A collection of converters I find useful.

Some new ones that are less prevalent:
1. Convert Powershell style base64 directly to a readable version
2. Convert Base64 encoded gzip and zlib to a readable version
3. Custom alphabet Base64 decoder
